# PhosphorEngine
This is an experiment learning project about Vulkan rendering and game engines. 
It's the early stage of the project.
## Features:
 - Simple rendering of models and basic lighting
 - Material system(unfinished)
 - Culling(unfinished)
 - Shadows(to be done)
 - Basic Game Sample[to be done)
 - Deferred rendering(to be done)

## Build
### Windows 
 - launch GenerateEngineProject and build/run VS solution.
## Dependencies
 - ImGui - GUI
 - Premake - for building of project
 - GLFW - window management
 - FastGLTF - for GLTF import
 - NLOHMANN_JSON/SIMD_JSON - json utils
 - STB - image loading
 - TinyOBJLoaded - for obj load
SpirvReflect - used for shader reflection, needed for material system
For using this engine, a Vulkan driver should be installed.
